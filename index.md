The unsustainable pursuit of industrial economic growth has put the marine and coastal ecosystems in 
southern Brazil under tremendous pressure. Macro and micro-scale pollution, industrial contaminants and 
increased volumes of litter are the key challenges facing the local communities around the Lagoa dos Patos 
(Duck Lagoon). At a macro scale, drinkable water is sourced from the Duck Lagoon to supply millions of 
households in many cities in the region. The ability to monitor chemical and micro-particle pollutants in bodies 
of water is key to being able to quantify the severity of the problem and create tailored interventions to reduce 
the amount of pollutants. Environmental monitoring has tangible social welfare and economic benefits to 
thousands of people in the coastal local communities who depend on these natural resources to make a living 
out of fishing and farming activities.

This interdisciplinary challenge-based project will focus on developing a low-cost autonomous solar powered 
pollution and micro-particulate sensing boat that has advanced A.I-based navigation and tracking capabilities. 
The ability to measure water parameters and pollutants in real time can give a much clearer picture of local 
challenges and patterns than manual coastal water quality surveys can achieve, enabling more advanced 
modeling, interventions and policies to be developed on the back of the resulting data. By making the boat 
autonomous and solar powered, we reduce the operational costs of monitoring and enable larger areas to be 
canvased with minimal intervention. We aim to co-develop with the local community an initial prototype of the 
autonomous boat that can measure and transmit live water parameters and pollution data while following 
canvasing patterns and locating areas of high pollution. The long-term vision is to empower communities in 
DAC countries with swarms of interconnected low-cost sensing and actuator boat technologies for water 
quality monitoring and restoration.
