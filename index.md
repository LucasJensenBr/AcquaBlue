                                        The unsustainable pursuit of industrial economic growth has put the marine and coastal ecosystems in 
southern Brazil under tremendous pressure. Macro and micro-scale pollution, industrial contaminants and 
increased volumes of litter are the key challenges facing the local communities around the Lagoa dos Patos 
(Duck Lagoon). At a macro scale, drinkable water is sourced from the Duck Lagoon to supply millions of 
households in many cities in the region. The ability to monitor chemical and micro-particle pollutants in bodies 
of water is key to being able to quantify the severity of the problem and create tailored interventions to reduce 
the amount of pollutants. Environmental monitoring has tangible social welfare and economic benefits to 
thousands of people in the coastal local communities who depend on these natural resources to make a living 
out of fishing and farming activities.
