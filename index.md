## Overview

<br/> The unsustainable pursuit of industrial economic growth has put the marine and coastal ecosystems in 
southern Brazil under tremendous pressure. In the state of Rio Grande do Sul, lies one of the largest coastal
lagoons in South America, know as Lagoa dos Patos (<Duck Lagoon ou Patos Lagoon?>). It streches 290 km
along the coast and has a single permanent channel connecting the lagoon to the Southern Atlanctic Ocean.

<br/> The lagoon's shore is densely populated in it's northern and southern ends. Besides the fact that the
lagoon supports many industrial, portuary, fishing and agricultural activities, it also
sustains a very large ecossystem and a very important carbon influx to the ocean.

## The Challenge

<br/> Macro and micro-scale pollution, industrial contaminants and increased volumes of litter are the key 
challenges facing the local communities around Duck Lagoon. At a macro scale, drinkable water is sourced 
from the Duck Lagoon to supply millions of households in many cities in the region. 

<br/> The ability to monitor chemical and micro-particle pollutants in bodies of water is key to being able 
to quantify the severity of the problem and create tailored interventions to reduce the amount of pollutants. 
Environmental monitoring has tangible social welfare and economic benefits to thousands of people in the 
coastal local communities who depend on these natural resources to make a living out of fishing and farming activities.

<br/> Although necessary, the environmental monitoring must tackle a number of obstacles to be implemented. 
Some in the form of logistical challenges, such as the need of ships, or the personnel trained for the 
execution of the monitoring. Others, in the form of financial and economic challenges, such as acquiring expensive 
scientific instruments, or the ship and crew’s budget, posing numerous barriers for the wide scale implementation 
of environmental monitoring.

## Motivation

<br/> With the technological advancements of the last decades, bringing:

<br/> . Increase of data processing capabilities;
<br/> . Modularization of sensors and processes;
<br/> . Reduction of components cost and size.
<br/> . IoT Scenario
