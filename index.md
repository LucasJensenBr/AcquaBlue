## Overview

<br/> The unsustainable pursuit of industrial economic growth has put the marine and coastal ecosystems in 
southern Brazil under tremendous pressure. In the state of Rio Grande do Sul, lies one of the largest coastal
lagoons in South America, know as Lagoa dos Patos **(<Duck Lagoon ou Patos Lagoon?>)**. It streches 290 km
along the coast and has a single permanent channel, connecting the lagoon to the Southern Atlanctic Ocean.

<br/> The lagoon's shore is densely populated in it's northern and southern ends. Besides the fact that the
lagoon supports many industrial, portuary, fishing and agricultural activities, it also
sustains a very large ecosystem and a very important carbon influx to the ocean.

## The Challenge

<br/> Macro and micro-scale pollution, industrial contaminants and increased volumes of litter are the key 
challenges facing the local communities around Duck Lagoon. At a macro scale, drinkable water is sourced 
from the **Duck Lagoon** to supply millions of households in many cities in the region. 
The ability to monitor chemical and micro-particle pollutants in bodies of water is key to being able 
to quantify the severity of the problem and create tailored interventions to reduce the amount of pollutants. 
Environmental monitoring has tangible social welfare and economic benefits to thousands of people in the 
coastal local communities who depend on these natural resources to make a living out of fishing and farming activities.

<br/> Although necessary, the environmental monitoring must tackle many obstacles to be implemented. 
Some, in the form of logistical challenges such as the need of ships, or the personnel trained for the 
execution of the monitoring. Others, in the form of financial and economic challenges, such as acquiring expensive 
scientific instruments, or the ship and crew’s budget, posing numerous barriers for the wide scale implementation 
of environmental monitoring.


## Motivation

<br/> With the fast technological advancements of recent years, bringing:

- Increase of data processing capabilities;
- Decrease of components cost and size;
- Modularization of sensors and processes;
- IoT Scenario.

<br/> The development of customized smart solutions for different applications is becoming not only a reality, but a promising
investment in the digital age. Applied to environmental research, it has the potential to support research endeavours and greatly
reduce costs.

enabling scientists, companys and the general public 

<br/> The project aims to develop a prototype platform consisting of an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV)
equipped with sensors for acquiring environmental information, autonomous navigation and the capability of sending
real time information to a ground sation or directly into the cloud. It is intended to integrate a solar
powered system for the optmization of energy consumption and extension of operation time.

## Goals and Action Points

### Stage 1

<br/> To develop and test autonomous navigation vessel equipped with sensors for aquisition of environmental parameters data 
and automatic display of the information on a ground station based near the operation area of the prototype

### Stage 2







## Design

<br/> **Inserir imagem sobre exemplo de architetura de um ASV (Liu, 2016) 


<br/> **Boat Structure:** The proposed design of the vessel consists of a catamaran type hull, which according to
similar projects, makes the boat more stable against wind or wave stresses.

<br/> **Propulsion System:** the boat will use two systems of rudders and propellers, on each side of the boat

## Pilot Sites

<br/> **Pilot Site 1** is a small area (15 km2) of the Patos Lagoon estuary, located
close to Rio Grande historical centre, with good access year-round and with
almost every meteorological condition. FURG has a museum facility on the
shore of the proposed pilot site, which also makes it easy to operate in this
area.

<br/> **Pilot Site 2** Comprises of a riverine area near de city of Pelotas called the
Canal de São Gonçalo (São Gonçalo Channel) and was chosen due do it's different water dynamics,
in order to test the boat's performance.

<br/> Dr. Marcelo Pias ...

<br/> Dr. Jorge Arigony is a Geographer, expert in using remote sensing (SAR, optical, UAV) and field based
methods and instruments (low-cost sensors, Automatic Weather Stations, Ground Penetrating Radar,
time-lapse cameras) for monitoring: (1) coastal oceanographic processes in South Brazil; and (2) the
cryosphere in Antarctica and Patagonia. His contribution to the project is focused on developing the
sampling strategy for water pollution monitoring (definition of key water parameters, sampling frequency
and sites), and analysing the climatology of environmental variables (wind and wave regime, water current
velocities) to define the operational conditions of the SmartBoat.
