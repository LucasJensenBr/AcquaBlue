This report summarizes the specifications of the RC boat FT012 and it's first tests on a pool


	Specifications:

		-Single-hull Boat 

			-top cover and middle (Waterproof) cover.
			-Presence of turn fins on both sides to facilitate steering at high speeds.
		
		-Powered by a 11.1V 1800mAh Li-po battery 

			-Battery charged by a 15V 800mA charger.
			-Balance charger connected between the charger and the battery.
			-Over 6 minutes o operation at full throttle.

		-Water cooling system for de DC motor and the Electronic Speed Controller (ESC)

			-Although the boat is advertised as waterproof, after the first pool tests, it was observed
			that there was water on the inside of the vessel, even after operating with closed covers.
			
			- The presence of a drain hole on the stern of the boat indicates that, altough the inner
			components may be waterproof, the hull itself is prone to water infiltration, even with the
			waterproof middle cover.
		
		-Length: 467mm / Width: 127mm / Height: 128mm

		-Single propeller; powered by a 3500Kv DC Brushless Motor and connected through a shaft.
			
			-Kv rate is the number of revolutions per minute of the motor when applied a voltage of 1 
			(without any load).
			-Not to be confused with Kilovolt(kV)
			-Ex: Boat battery at full charge (12.1 VDC)
			     3500(Kv) * 12.1(V) = 42,350 (Máx RPM)


		-Steering of the boat by the rudder; Rudder connected to a servo (Unknown specifications) 
		through a solid metal bar.

		- No information is given about the ESC.
			
			-ESC wraped in water-proofing material
			-DC brushless motor and servo motor connected to the ESC
			-ESC must have an integrated radio receiver for intercepting signals sent by the Controller

		-Radio controller of 2.4 GHz

			-Powered  by 6 AA batteries (9V).
			-Advertised signal reach of approximately 150 meters.
			-Commands the boat through radio signals (Transmitter).
			-Steering throuh the direction Knob.
			-Throttle control through the trigger.

			-Other features:

				-On/Off switch.
				-Power Indicator (Red LED).
				-Frequency Matching Indicator (Green LED).
				-Directional fine ajustment knob for the rudder.
				-Servo adjustment Knob (rudder offset).
					*Used for adjustments in steering due to wind interference.

		-Additional components

			-2 extra propellers
			-2 anti-colision boat sleeves
			-Motor-Shaft coupler lubricant
			-2 extra coupler screws
			-1 Allen Key for coupler screws
			-1 wrench

	Step-by-step guide for operation

		*For the first time operating the boat, it is recommended to apply the lubricant to the coupler of the 
		shaft and the Brushless motor

		1° Boat battery
			-If the battery isn't charged, connect it to the balance charge through the four pin connection.
			-Connect the balance charger to the charger through the P4 connection.
			-Connect the charger to the power outlet.
			-A red and a green LED will lighten, when the battery is fully charged, the red LED will go off.
				*Do not remove the battery from the charger until the red LED is off.
			-Open the top and middle covers of the boat by twisting the cover switches to the indicated direction in the hull
			-Insert the battery in the slot
			-Connect the battery to the loose two-pins connection plug, paying very close attention to the polarity of the wires
			-Put the covers back on and close the switches

			*After every operation, recharge the batteries
			*Do not change or modify the battery or the charger
			*SAFETY WARNING: the propeller can trigger immediatly after connected to the battery, be carefull to your
			surroundings when installing the battery


		2° Controller Battery

			-Remove the lid on the base of the controller with the aid of a screwdriver
			-Insert 6 AA batteries (1.5V) in the slots
			-Close the lid

			*Do not mix new and used batteries on the controller

		3° Operation

			-Install the anti-collision sleeve
			-Put the boat in the water (close to the controller)
			-Turn the switch on the controller to ON
			*Red light atnd blinking green light will turn ON
			*The green light indicates the connection between the controller and the boat.
			*When the green LED is ON continuously the connection between boat and controller is established
			-Make fine ajustments on the offset and sensitivity of the rudder if necessary
			-Pull the throttle trigger to go foward.
			-Push the throttle trigger to go in reverse.
			-Turn the direction knob clockwise to go right
			-Turn the direction knob anti-clockwise to go left

			*In case of boat flipping over, push the throttle and immediately pull it repeatedly until boat is
			flipped

	After operation/Inspection/Maintenance


		-Remove and recharge the boat battery.
		-Remove batteries from the controller.
		-Dry the inside of the boat with a clean and dry with soft cloth.
		-Add lubricant to the shaft coupler.
		-Keep the boat off direct sunlight and humidity when not in use.
